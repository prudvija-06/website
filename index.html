        <article>
        <p>Kajal A Kitchlu (née Aggarwal;[1] born 19 June 1985[2]), known professionally as Kajal Aggarwal, is an Indian actress who predominantly works in Telugu and Tamil films, as well as some Hindi films.[3] She is a recipient of three South Indian International Movie Awards along with four Filmfare Awards South nominations. Aggarwal is considered as one of the highest paid actresses in South Indian cinema, according to various media reports.

            Aggarwal made her acting debut with a minor role in the 2004 Hindi film Kyun! Ho Gaya Na... and had her first Telugu film release in Lakshmi Kalyanam (2007). In the same year, she gained wider recognition for her role in Chandamama. The 2009 fantasy film Magadheera, one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of all time, marked a turning point in her career and earned her critical acclaim.
            
            Her other notable Telugu films include Darling (2010), Brindavanam (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), Businessman (2012), Naayak (2013), Baadshah (2013), Govindudu Andarivadele (2014), Temper (2015), Khaidi No. 150 (2017), Nene Raju Nene Mantri (2017), Awe (2018) and Bhagavanth Kesari (2023).[10] She has also played the female lead in high-profile Tamil projects such as Naan Mahaan Alla (2010), Maattrraan (2012), Thuppakki (2012), Jilla (2014), Vivegam (2017), Mersal (2017) and Comali (2019).[11] Her most successful Hindi films include the action film Singham (2011) and the thriller Special 26 (2013).
            
            In 2020, a wax figure of Aggarwal was put on display at Madame Tussauds Singapore, making it the first of an actress from South Indian cinema.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>Film debut and struggles (2004–08)</h3>
        <p>Aggarwal made her acting debut in the 2004 Bollywood film Kyun! Ho Gaya Na..., in which she had a minor supporting role.

            Aggarwal made her debut in Telugu and played her first leading role in 2007 in Teja's Lakshmi Kalyanam, alongside Kalyan Ram; it did not fare well at the box office. Later that year, she appeared in the Krishna Vamsi-directed Chandamama, which opened to positive reviews and became her first major successful film. In 2008, she had her first Tamil film release, Perarasu's action entertainer Pazhani, opposite Bharath. She had one more Tamil release that year with Venkat Prabhu's comedy-thriller Saroja, in which she did a guest appearance. Although the film went on to become a commercial as well as a critical success,[24] the film failed to boost her career as her role was too insignificant. Her Telugu releases Pourudu and Aatadista opposite Sumanth and Nitin, respectively, did not receive positive reviews, but both were successful at the box office</p>

        <h2>Accolades</h2>
        <p>Aggarwal has received four Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu nominations — for the films, Magadheera, Darling, Mr. Perfect and Govindudu Andarivadele</p>
